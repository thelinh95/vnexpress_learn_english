For a long time, I get away with doing the bare minimum at school, and my Spanish really suffered.
I live in a tiny village with no public transport. I want to get away and explore another culture.

I knew that if I want to go ahead, I had to do more than just attend my school class.

I explained my situation with my parents, and they got behind me.

They told me that if I wanted to go abroad, I should go out and find a job!

I got into it straightaway, and found a job in a local pub.

Once I had saved enough money, I call a language academy in Seville. I go thought to the manager and I Book a week-long residential course.

When I arrived Seville, I met all of my classmates and we got on really well.

I found that I could get by with the little Spanish I knew.

As I got older, I found that getting a couple of Drinks down make me confident.

I made lot of Spanish friends and couldn't get over how much I improved by talking to them everyday on WhatsApp.

I felt good when I can get my thoughts, feelings across.

I really got into Spanish TV Shows, series, and this help a lot.

I start working as hard as I could, and every time I got work off, I count my money to see if I could afford another trip
to Spanish again.

I manage to go twice more and each time I got back to I tried to plan another trip.

I have a Spanish boyfriend, But we broke up and got back together a few times.

Seville has a very special place in my hear. Every time I got there I get together with all of my old friends to reminisce.
