============================================

For along time, I got away with DOING THE bear minimum at school, and my Spanish really suffer.
I live in a tiny village with no PUBLIC transport.
I want to get away and explore another culture.
I knew that if I wanted to get ahead, I had to do more than just attend my school classes.

I shared my situation with my parents, and they got behind me.
They told me that, If I want to go aboard, I must get out and find a job.

I got on it straightaway, and found a job in a local pub.

Once I have enough money, I call a language academy in Seville.
I got through to the manager to book a week-long course.

When I arrived Seville, I met all my new classmates and we get on really well.

I found that I could get by with the little Spanish I knew.

As I got older, I found that getting a couple of Drinks down make me confident.

I made a lot of Spaninsh friends, and I couldn't get over how much I improve
by chat with them everyday on Whatsapp.

I feel good when I can get my thoughts, felling across.

I really got into Spanish TV, series, and this help me a lot.

I started working as hard as I could. Whenever I get off work, I count my moneyto see if
I can afford another trip.

I manage to go twice more and every time I got back, I tried to plan another trip.

I had a Spanish boyfriend, but we broke up and get back a few times.

Seville has a very special place in my hear and every time I to there, I get together with my
old friends.
